# TranqAuricle 

TranqAuricle stands for Tranquil (Calm) + Auricle (Ear). It is a portable and non-invasive ear device backed with Lm35 temperature sensor, pulse sensor and vibration sensor attached to a methylcyclohexane gel cascade. When core anxiety symptoms like increase in heart beat rate or body temperature is measured, the device detects the parameters and starts vibrations across ears lobes along with partially penetrating methylcylohexane gel at the same regionwhich has been clinically proven to lessen anxiety symptoms.
